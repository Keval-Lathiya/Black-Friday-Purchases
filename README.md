# Black-Friday-Purchases

## Task
Using this data from Walmart Inc. we want to analyze the customer purchase behavior (specifically, purchase amount) against the customerâ€™s gender and the various other factors to help the business make better decisions. We want to understand if the spending habits differ between male and female customers: Do women spend more on Black Friday than men?
